# Research Overview — David Morillas Armendáriz

This repository provides a structured overview of my research work at the
intersection of computational neuroscience, complex systems, and numerical
modeling. It gathers references, code, reproducible experiments, and ongoing
investigations across several domains:

- Neural and cortico-hippocampal models of learning and predictive cognition
- Fractal and multi-scale structures in spatial and symbolic data
- Computational exploration of prime number distribution and generative models
- Large-scale data visualization, graph structures, and pattern extraction

The objective is not to assert final conclusions, but to develop, document,
and refine **reproducible methods** for exploring structure in high-dimensional
systems—mathematical, neural, or informational.

## Research Lines

### 1. Neural Dynamics & Cognitive Models
Models focused on memory encoding, sequence prediction, and self-organizing
representations drawing inspiration from hippocampal-cortical interactions.

**Keywords:** predictive coding, attractor systems, episodic memory, temporal
sequence learning, spatial representation.

Repository (private / in progress).

---

### 2. Fractal and Multi-Scale Spatial Structures
Study of fractal geometry, non-euclidean metric structures, and scale-adaptive
representations in spatial and symbolic systems.

Work derived from early research at the **Cartography Service, UAM**.

---

### 3. Computational Exploration of Prime Number Sequences

**Goal:** Investigate structural and statistical patterns in prime distribution  
using analytical approximations, fractal transforms, and computational validation.

This line includes two open-science experimental frameworks:

#### • Morillas–Fourier Method (MFM)
A computational approach combining fractal transforms and frequency-domain
analysis to generate candidate prime distributions.

Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX  
Repository: https://github.com/DavidMorillas/Morillas-Fourier-Method-MFM

#### • Hybrid Fractal + ML Prediction Framework
Combines analytical approximations with machine learning residual correction
and adaptive weighting schemes.

Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.YYYYYYY  
Code included for full reproducibility.

**Note:** These works are presented as **computational and exploratory
investigations**, not as proofs of conjectures in number theory.

## Reproducibility & Data

All results are:
- Fully reproducible from the published Python scripts
- Guided by explicit parameter settings and version control
- Documented via notebooks and analysis logs when applicable
