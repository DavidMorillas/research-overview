# Research Overview — David Morillas Armendáriz

This repository provides a structured overview of my research at the intersection
of **computational neuroscience, complex systems, and numerical modeling**.
It consolidates references, code, reproducible experiments, and ongoing
investigations across several domains:

- Neural and cortico-hippocampal models of learning and predictive cognition  
- Fractal and multi-scale structures in spatial and symbolic data  
- Computational exploration of prime number distributions and generative models  
- Large-scale data visualization, graph structures, and pattern extraction  

The objective is not to assert final theoretical conclusions, but to **develop,
test, and refine reproducible methods** for exploring structure in
high-dimensional systems—biological, mathematical, or informational.

## Research Lines

### 1. Neural Dynamics & Cognitive Models *(primary ongoing research)*
Models focused on memory encoding, predictive coding, attractor dynamics,
sequence learning, and hippocampal–cortical interaction.

**Keywords:** predictive coding, episodic memory, CA3/EC loop dynamics,
self-organizing representations, neural simulation.

**Status:** Private (in preparation for publication).

### 2. Fractal and Multi-Scale Spatial Structures
Study of fractal geometry and scale-adaptive representation systems,
originating from work conducted at the **Cartography Service (SCUAM), UAM**.

Includes:
- Spatial multi-resolution modeling  
- Structure extraction across scales  
- Symbolic–spatial representation frameworks

## 3. Computational Exploration of Prime Number Sequences

**Goal:** Investigate structural and statistical patterns in prime distribution
via analytical approximations, fractal transforms, and computational validation.

### • Morillas–Fourier Method (MFM)
A computational framework combining fractal functional transforms with
frequency-domain analysis to generate candidate prime distributions.
